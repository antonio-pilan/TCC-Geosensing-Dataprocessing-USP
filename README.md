## Overview

This repository presents the Final Thesis of my undergraduate research project.

Using GOES-16 Satellite data, i've studied Land Surface Temperature and Total Preciptable Water and understood the algorithms behind satellites pre-processing.

The results were good, i was abble to relate heavy burns that happened in Brazil on the interest location with high temperatures and low water on atmosphere and understand and characterize the behaviour of the two variables on the region year by year.

Python was mainly used with Pandas, Numpy, Pyproj, Matplotlib and many other libraries needed for processing and visualizing data.

This study is open for citation and usage, feel free to use the codes and commands at will. (cite me if possible!)
